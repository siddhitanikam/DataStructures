# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my collection of C++ programs implementing various data structures and algorithms!

## Files Included

1. AvlTree.cpp - Implementation of an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.
2. DFS_BFS.cpp - Implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms on graphs.
3. DijkstrasAndPrims.cpp - Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
4. MaxflowAndBipartite.cpp - Implementation of algorithms for finding maximum flow in a flow network and checking for bipartiteness in a graph.
5. MergeSort.cpp - Implementation of the merge sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
6. RedBlackTree.cpp - Implementation of a Red-Black tree, a balanced binary search tree.

## How to Run

You can compile and run these programs in your terminal using any C++ compiler like g++.

For example, to compile and run AvlTree.cpp:

```bash
g++ AvlTree.cpp -o AvlTree
./AvlTree
